<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04


<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

Actions:

1- Deploy a new virtual machine, web server, or database server to support osTicket.

2- Scale the osTicket system up or down to handle changes in user demand or traffic.

3- Backup the osTicket data and files to protect against data loss or system failure.

4- Restore osTicket data and files from a backup in the event of a disaster or system failure.

5- Upgrade the web server, PHP, or database server to a newer version to improve performance and security.


Observations:

1- Monitor the osTicket system using Azure Monitor to detect and respond to issues such as server downtime or performance issues.

2- Analyze osTicket usage data to identify trends and patterns, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and scaling.

3- Create customized reports on osTicket performance, user activity, and other metrics using Azure Reporting.

4- Set up alerts and notifications to receive real-time notifications when issues arise, or when certain performance thresholds are exceeded.

5- Review logs and audit trails to track changes to the osTicket system and ensure compliance with security and data protection policies.
